# HD Texture Pack for Crazy Taxi
HD Texture Pack for Crazy Taxi (GameCube Version) for use with the Dolphin Emulator.

These HD textures were made with the open source AI upscaling program called ERSGAN using the 4xSGI model. I also did some touchups by hand. I think most people will appreciate how the resulting texture pack is faithful to the original, while being much sharper and cleaner than the original textures.

To use, go to [Releases](https://github.com/TheCatCoder/CrazyTaxiHDTextures/releases) and download the zip folder of the HD textures. Then you simply place the unzipped folder full of PNG files (named GCTE51) into the Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures folder.
